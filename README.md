# Data_Visualisation
some complicated data visualisation works.

Why I think these visualisation works are complicated, as using matplotily, seaborn or other package via python has lots of limitations,
e.g., hard to tune the transparency in seaborn pairplot and also hard to customerize the xticklabel or y ticklabel one by one. Moreover,
it is also very difficult to find some solution on stakcoverflow to add annotations on col_color bar or row_color bar in a cluster map.

I hope you guys like my code and contribute for more concise solutions.
